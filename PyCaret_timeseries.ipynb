A normal machine learning workflow in PyCaret starts with setup(), followed by comparing all models using compare_models() and shortlisting a few candidate models (based on the metric of interest) to perform several modeling techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, ensembling, stacking etc. This workflow will eventually lead you to the best model for use in making predictions on new and unseen data. The finalize_model() function fits the model onto the complete dataset including the test/hold-out sample (30% in this case). The purpose of this function is to train the model on the complete dataset before it is deployed in production."
